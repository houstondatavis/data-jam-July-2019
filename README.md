# data-jam-July-2019
dataset for july 2019 data jam on a dataset of open-source projects from federal government agencies

The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for code.gov, a site that aggregates open-source code projects from across government agencies. Code.gov <a href="https://www.code.gov/about/compliance/inventory-code">establishes</a> metadata standards for code.json to follow and where they should go in order to be automatically harvested for inclusion in code.gov. Each federal agency should be storing their code.json in a page like data.<agency name>.gov/code.json. For example, data.nasa.gov/code.json. 

## Code.gov API
Code.gov has relatively recently started providing an API, which is described <a href="https://developers.code.gov/basics.html"> here</a>.

You have to request an API key to use the API, but it is a quick proces to get one.

### Observable Data Visualization Notebooks that Use the Code.gov API are linked to from their website!

### Github Repository of Useful & Related Code
https://github.com/GSA/code-gov

The link above is a repository that links to all other code.gov related repositories. A lot of the code for their websites and API is all public on github.com.

#### There are also some example Jupyter notebooks that are work looking at:
 
<a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-stats">Code.gov Stats</a>

<a href="https://github.com/GSA/code-gov-stats-jupyter-notebook"> Code.gov notebooks for demoing what can be done with the API</a> There is one here that is used for getting out github stats like forks and stars that has been useful. An exported CSV file from that notebook enabled creation of <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/public-engagement-with-nasas-open-source-code-projects-on-g">this</a> Observable data visualization of popular NASA code repositories.
